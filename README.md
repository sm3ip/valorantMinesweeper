# valorantMinesweeper
This project is a simple minesweeper with a valorant theme (all artwork by me [sm3ip])
If you got wallpaper engine on steam here's the link to its workshop page (yeah I made it into a wallpaper, don't ask why) : https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3029038904
If you don't there is a release on the repo (tho it won't run as a wallpaper but as an actual game) : https://github.com/sm3ip/valorantMinesweeper/releases
